Install in the root of your Drupal 7 installation.

Edit convertphpbb.php to set database credentials
set USERS,FORUMS and POSTS to true
Alter the STEPSIZE if needed, it's the amount of posts, users etc that is converted at once.

Drop into a shell, and run php convertphpbb.php, make some coffee, give your cat some sweet love etc. This is going to take a little ;)


Oh, and no… this software comes without any warranty what so ever!
